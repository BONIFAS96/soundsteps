# SoundSteps Demo Script: "The Last Mile Education Solution"

## ðŸŽ¯ OPENING HOOK (60 seconds)
"Good [morning/afternoon], judges. Imagine a 12-year-old student in rural Kenya. No smartphone, no internet, no electricity most days. But she has one thing - a basic phone that can receive SMS messages. 

Today, I'll show you how SoundSteps reaches the last mile of education using the most ubiquitous technology in Africa - SMS messaging."

## ðŸ“Š PROBLEM STATEMENT (90 seconds)
"In sub-Saharan Africa:
- 99% have access to SMS messaging
- Only 60% have smartphones  
- 40% lack reliable internet
- Traditional e-learning solutions reach less than 30% of students

The question isn't how to build fancy apps - it's how to reach the 70% that existing solutions miss."
